## Project proposal 

As was shown in Haspelmath's Paper, predictability --- is the most comprehensive explanation of alienability contrasts in adpossessive constructions. However, quantative part of proof was omitted in the original paper. In this research we try to use a number of quantative methods to answer following questions:

1. What specific frequencies do we want to consider to determine predictability?

2. Is there a difference in these frequences in languages with asymetry and without? 

3. Is there a corelation between these frequences and the number of languages with such asymetry?
